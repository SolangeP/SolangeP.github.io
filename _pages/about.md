bio:  I have a Ph.D in applied mathematics, and especially statistics and machine learning. I did it at <a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/">  CMAP</a> (Ecole Polytechnique) and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/heka/">  HeKA</a> (PariSanteCampus), under the supervision of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/">  Stéphanie Allassonnière</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-sophie-jannot-a2286ba1/"> Anne-Sophie Jannot</a>. My research project was mainly about statistical learning algorithms, mixture models, and applications to public health data.
